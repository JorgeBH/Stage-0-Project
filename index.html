<h1>Hi ! this are the notes of Jorge Becerril Hernandez.</h1>
<br>
Hope this first <b>Stage 0 project</b> helps me to do better in <b>HTML</b>.
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the first course part we learned:
<br>
<br>
<h3>How the <b>web</b> is composed and how it works:</h3>
<br>
<br>
- The world wide web is composed by a huge number of documents and to be specific: <b><em>HTML Documents</em></b>
<br>
<br>
- The components to make the WWW work are: HTML Docs, Protocol (HTTP), Servers (in which are hosted this Docs), Web Browser, and the Internet itself.
<br>
<br>
<h3>What is the Hypertext Markup Language and how it works:</h3>
<br>
To be specific the HTML is constituted by a structure made of <b><em>TAGS</em></b> and those may have or may have not whats called <b>attributes</b>.
<br>
<br>
This tags allow to give format and more readable structure to documents. This is what makes possible to give an HTML document dynamism.
<br>
<br>
You can check this <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/">HTML Reference List</a> so you can search and play with the tags.
